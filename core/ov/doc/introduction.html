<h2>1 Introduction<br>
</h2>
The generic object management system ACPLT/OV enables an easy use of
object management functionality in process control components. This
functionality can be devided into the following groups:
<br>
<h3>1.1 Management of objects and their relationships<br>
</h3>
<p>Objects and their relationships are stored in a persistent database.
At run time, objects and their relationsships (which are described by
links) may be created or deleted and attributes or objects may be read
or modified. Rather than just storing data, objects own operations
encapsulating their functionality. Objects may even be active objects,
which means that they are actively process data. The complete contents
of a database can always be exported to the generic human-readable
ACPLT/OV instance desription language which may be modified and be
reimported to an existing or new database.
<br>
</p>
<h3>1.2 Implementation of objects and their relationships</h3>
<p>Objects are classified by (object) classes, relationships are
classified by associations. The implementation of classes is carried
out in ANSI C which provides a high portability - ACPLT/OV not only
runs on a workstation but also on a microcontroller! While ANSI C
lacks a support for object oriented programming, the ACPLT/OV C code
generator automatically creates virtual function tables and the
ACPLT/OV library helps out with many functions and macros supporting
the object oriented programming style. The input for the C code
generator is the ACPLT/OV modelling language (see below).
Implementations of classes and associations are grouped to libraries,
which may be DLLs or shared libraries and can be loaded into the
system at run time.<br>
</p>
<h3>1.3 Information about information: meta information<br>
</h3>
<p>The class and association definitions provided by the ACPLT/OV
modelling language do not only support the implementation; rather they
are converted into meta objects, which are instances of the ACPLT/OV
meta model. If a library is loaded, these meta objects are instantiated
in the database. The benefits are:
- Reflection: Objects may explore the meta information about themselves
or other objects (of which class they are, which variables they own or
the like).
- Introspection: Clients may explore the database, which is -- due to
the meta information -- self descriptive. This means, that you do NOT
have to configure anything to access any information (see the following
topic).
<br>
</p>
<h3>1.4 Information access at run time<br>
</h3>
<p>The information stored in the attributes of the managed objects as
well
as structural information about the objects and their relationships can
be accessed over the network through an integrated ACPLT/KS server.
<br>
</p>
<h3>1.5 Engineering functionality at run time<br>
</h3>
<p>ACPLT/OV does not only show "a picture of the world inside" but also
allows to modify the (engineered) structure of the object system
through
the CreateObject, DeleteObject, Link and Unlink services provided by
the integrated ACPLT/KS server.<br>
