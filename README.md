This is the source code of a runtime environment for the process control domain. It is developed since around 1999 at the [Chair of Process Control Engineering](http://www.plt.rwth-aachen.de) at the RWTH Aachen University.
It is well known in the German process control community under the name of the core technology ACPLT/OV.

Right now the build system is partly hard coded to the internal SVN server of the chair, we try to change that in the future.

The runtime environment runs on Linux (x86, x64, ARM) and Windows (x86, x64).

The runtime environment is used at industry scale in the petro chemical plants at INEOS in Cologne.
