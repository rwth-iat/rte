<H1>Frequently asked questions about ONC RPC for Windows NT</H1>
<hr>

<P>If you want your question to go here, please send a mail to <A HREF="mailto:gergeleit@gmd.de">gergeleit@gmd.de</A>.
I will put any question that might help other users of my port on this
page.</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Q: What is the difference between this ONC RPC and Microsoft RPC?</B></LI>

<P>A: ONC RPC (formerly calles Sun RPC) is a de-facto RPC standard for
Unix. It is included in all major Unix distributions. Microsoft RPC (MS
RPC) is a different RPC system and it is interoperable with OSF/DCE RPC.
OSF/DCE is also available for nearly al OSs, but usually it is not part
of the standard distribution. OSF/DCE RPC is newer and a little bit more
powerful than ONC RPC, but for most applications both RPC systems will
do the job. ONC RPC and OSF/DCE RPC (and thus MS RPC) are <B>not</B> interoperable
at all.</P>

<LI><B>Q: I want to write an application which is distributed across Unix
boxes and NT-machines. Can ONC RPC help me to do that?</B></LI>

<P>A: ONC RPC is exactly what you need. This port for NT and the Unix-implementations
are interoperable (thanks to XDR from Sun).</P>

<LI><B>Q: I want to port an application from Unix to NT. Can ONC RPC help
me to do that?</B></LI>

<P>A: Again, ONC RPC is exactly what you need. This port for NT and the
Unix-implementations have the same APIs (but don't forget to call &quot;rpc
_nt_init()&quot; and &quot;rpc_nt_exit()&quot; in the client code).</P>

<LI><B>Q: What about the copyright? May I use this code in my (commercial) application?</B></LI>

<P>A: You may use, copy or modify ONC RPC for Windows NT according to 
the <A HREF="copyrght.txt">Sun copyright</A>. In my understanding this includes the free
use in your (commercial) applications. Please read the <A HREF="Copyrght.htm">standard disclaimer</A>.</P>

<LI><B>Q: Does this port also work with Windows95?</B></LI>

<P>A<B>:</B> Yes, everything but the portmapper <I>service </I>will work
(Windows95 does not support the service API). You don't need the portmapper
at all, if you write a client-only application on Windows 95. For a server
the ascii version of the portmapper (pm_ascii.exe) is ok as well and this
runs also on Windows95. Also, it is easy to learn from NTs service implementation
how to run the portmapper as one thread of a GUI application.</P>

<LI><B>Q: Does this port also work with Windows 3.1?</B></LI>

<P>A<B>:</B> No, this has never been a goal of my port. Maybe, some parts
(client, XDR) run on Win32s, but I never tested that.</P>

<LI><B>Q: Do you know a port of ONC RPC that runs on Windows 3.1?</B></LI>

<P>A: I known some companies that offer RPC products commercially, but
I dont't know about the details (see <A HREF="http://www.noblenet.com">www.noblenet.com</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.netmanage.com">www.netmanage.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.distinct.com">www.distinct.com</A>,
and <A HREF="http://www.intergraph.com">www.intergraph.com</A> (called
RhaPC-d).</P>

<LI><B>Q: Is there a tutorial on how to use ONC RPC?</B></LI>

<P>A: Have a look at this <A HREF="http://www.eng.auburn.edu/department/cse/classes/cse605/examples/rpc/stevens/SUNrpc.html">short
lesson</A> based on UNIX Network Programming from W. Richard Stevens, Prentice
Hall, Inc., consult the <A HREF="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mac/manuals/solaris-manual-pages/solaris/usr/man/man3n/rpc.3n.html">Solaris
(SunOS) manuals</A>, or a good <A HREF="http://www.ora.com/gnn/bus/ora/item/rpc.html">book</A>
on ONC RPC programming.</P>

<LI><B>Q. How do I set up the demo programs provided with the distribution?</B><BR>
<BR>
</LI>

<P>A: For testing you should log in as &quot;Administrator&quot;. Copy
'oncrpc.dll' to the windows system32 directory. Then you should open three
command line interfaces.<BR>
- in the first start 'pm_ascii'<BR>
- in the second start 'cou_svc'<BR>
- in the third start 'do_cou localhost'<BR>
This should result in some local action. If this works you should install
the portmapper service by copying portmap.exe also to the windows system32
diretory. Then register it using inst_pm (e.g. 'inst_pm c:\winnt35\system32\portmap.exe').
Then start the portmapper with the service control panel. Then do the test
again and leave out the first step 'pm_ascii'.<BR>
If this also works you have the infrastructure installed for compiling
your own ONC RPC applications. For building them you will need the rpcgen
stub generator, the oncrpc.lib in the linker comand line and the directory
'rpc' with the include files in the compilers include path.</P>

<LI><B>Q: Which compilers are supported?</B></LI>

<P>A: The current distribution runs out-of-the-box only with MS VC++ (works
with all 32 bit versions, but best with version 4.2). Sorry I have no Borland
or Watcom compiler availabel.</P>

<LI><B>Q: I tried to recompile ONC RPC with MS VC++ and it gave me a lot
of warning. Is this OK?</B><BR>
<BR>
</LI>

<P>A: Yes, you should ignore these warnings. I did only those changes to
the original code that were absolutly necessary to get it running (always
included in #ifdef WIN32). I did not try to make it more ANSI C like.</P>

<LI><B>Q: When I start rpcgen.exe it terminates with an error:
&quot;..\bin\rpcgen: unable to open cl: No such file or directory&quot;.
What's wrong?</B><BR>
<BR>
</LI>

<P>A: It tried to call the C preprocessor, namely &quot;cl.exe&quot; from VC++.
It couldn't execute it. Make sure it is in the standard path.</P>

<LI><B>Q: When I use control panel to start the portmapper service, I received
&quot;error 5, access is denied&quot;. Do you know why?</B><BR>
<BR>
</LI>

<P>A: I assume you entered a wrong executable for the portmap service when
using inst_pm. Sorry for the unprecise description, but you have to enter
the full pathname <B>plus </B>the filename of the executable i.e. you have
to enter something like: <I>inst_pm c:\winnt\system32\portmap.exe. </I>If
it still fails, please check in with regedt32 in the current_control\service
section the entered executable for the portmap service.</P>

<LI><B>Q: I have strange problems when using XDR file-streams. Do you know what might be wrong?</B><BR>
<BR>
</LI>

<P>A: Make sure you are using a <i>binary</i> file. This awful "CR-LF" translation often breaks ported code.</P>

<LI><B>Q: Is it really neccessary to compile the source code?</B></LI>

<P>A: No, if you are willing to trust me (and the others who did the compilation)
and the compilers and you work with NT on Intel,PowerPC,orALPHA you can
use the provided binaries.</P>

<LI><B>Q: How do I integrate GUI-Code and ONC RPC stubs?</B></LI>

<P>A: An easy way to do GUI-integration is to use separate threads that
execute the RPC server-loop and maybe also the client. These threads should
communicate with the GUI threads via events. In order to use the server-stub
in another program, you have to redefine the &quot;main()&quot; to something
else like e.g. &quot;server_main()&quot;. You can do this with the preprocessor
if you don't want to change the 'rpcgen'-generated file.</P>

<LI><B>Q: How do I integrate ONC RPC stubs with MS VC++ 4.0 projects (written
in real C++)?</B></LI>

<P>A: I would recommend to define a C subproject that produces a library
with the (C-)stubs in it. Then use this lib and the &quot;rpcgen&quot;-generated
header-file (included in 'extern &quot;C&quot; {...}) in your C++ main
project.</P>

<LI><B>Q: Do you have an MFC integration for ONC RPC?</B></LI>

<P>A: No.</P>

<LI><B>Q: Do you have a version of rpcgen, that can produce C++ code?</B></LI>

<P>A: No, but version 1.11 produces header-files that are at least a little
bit more understandable for C++.</P>

<P>to be continued ...</P>
