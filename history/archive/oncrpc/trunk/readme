The ONC/RPC package for Windows 2000/NT/95/98

IMPORTANT:

When choosing the "Custom" setup type, only 
select the "Portmap NT Service" for installation
when installing on a Windows NT machine. Although
this package can also be selected on Windows
95/98/01 systems, the installation will then fail.

The "Typical" setup type installs the binary files,
the ONC/RPC DLL and the header files, so you can
also develop ONC/RPC applications.

If you only want to install the ONC/RPC DLL then
choose the "Compact" setup type.

To install the source code of the ONC/RPC package,
you need to choose the "Custom" setup type and
then manually select the source code package.
