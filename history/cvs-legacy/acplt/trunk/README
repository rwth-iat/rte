The ACPLT/KS C++ Communication Library
======================================

This is version 1.0.5pre3 of the C++ Communication Libary. As always, it
contains bug-fixes and some small improvements behind the scenes. For
details about bug-fixes and changes, see part 3 "Changes & Bug-Fixes"
of this document below.

But now, compile and enjoy --
  Your ACPLT/KS team <ks@plt.rwth-aachen.de>


1. Introduction
---------------

The "C++ Communication Library" eases the integration of the open
communication system ACPLT/KS into applications, thus enabling them to
operate directly with process data.

For up-to-date information see
    http://www.plt.rwth-aachen.de/ks/english
or
    http://www.plt.rwth-aachen.de/ks (German)

From there, you can also download the "Technology Paper #8" which
describes the "C++ Communication Library" in detail.


2. Compiling the Library
------------------------

2.1 Un*x
--------

Make sure you have the right tools: gcc, gmake, and perl.

Change to the root of the library tree, that is the "acplt" directory,
where this README file is stored too. Choose your weapons -- pardon,
operating system -- and then do:

  $ make linux.all

This will build the library as well as some example applications. If
appropriate, replace "linux" with either "hpux", "irix", or "solaris".


2.2 NT/95
---------

On NT/95, take your chances, and do (Borland C++):

  X:\acplt> make -f makefile.nt nt.all

or (Microshaft Visual C+):

  X:\acplt> nmake -f makefile.nt nt.all

During the compilation of the example applications you'll see some
linker warnings like (Borland C++ only):

  Warning: Extern '_xdr_XXX' was not qualified with __import in module XXX

You can safely ignore these warnings, as there is some compiler/linker
magic necessary to export variables from DLLs unter Windows NT/95, and
this magic gets sometimes dazzled (bad magic, huh?).

When using VC+ 4.2, you'll see warnings about the "use of nonstandard
extensions" -- ignore them. The irony behind this is that the C++
Communication Library emulates such "nonstandard extensions" like the bool
data type because Microsoft does not adhere to the C++ language standard.


2.3 OpenVMS
-----------

Create a directory for the CXX repository, for example CXX_REPOSITORY.DIR
in your home directory. Then define the symbol acplt$repository, which must
point to this directory. Finally do a

  $ gmake openvms.all

That's it. This will build the library as well as the examples.


3. Changes & Bug-Fixes
----------------------

Version 1.0.5
- CLIENTS & SERVERS: links and archives added.

Version 1.0.4
- CLIENTS: Fixed a bug which caused A/V modules to be ignored which
  were attached to data exchange packets.

- SERVERS: Introduced server-side dynamic XDR streams. They can be
  enabled with -DPLT_USE_BUFFERED_STREAMS=1 (see makefiles). If enabled,
  client requests will first be read in completely before processing
  them. Also the replies will first be deserialized completely into a
  dynamic XDR stream before sending them to a client. This way blocking
  i/o during receiving requests or sending replies does not block servers
  anymore until the 30 second timeout occurs. The streams are NOT enabled
  by default, as they're relatively new and we want to test them even
  more before rolling them out officially.

Version 1.0.3
- SERVERS: Fixed a bug which sometimes caused the port number setting
  to be ignored.

- CLIENTS: Fixed a small bug related to error handling when scanning a
  resource locator for an explicit port number.

Version 1.0.2
- CLIENTS: Fixed a bug which crashed applications creating communication
  objects with an invalid host and/or server name like "//x//a/b/c".

- CLIENTS: The resource locator syntax has been extended to accept an
  optional port number after the hostname, for example:
    "//rumpelpumpel.acme.org:2000/MANAGER/vendor/server_time"
  If no port number is specified, an ACPLT/KS client will look up the
  manager's port address using the portmapper on the host specified in
  the resource locator. If the port number is specified (separated by
  a colon from the host name) then a client will contact the ACPLT/KS
  manager directly at this port. The purpose of this is that you can
  now controll the access to ACPLT/KS servers through firewalls without
  necessarily granting access to the portmapper. If the optional port
  number is used, a client will contact the ACPLT/KS manager using a
  TCP/IP connection instead of UDP/IP. This makes firewall configurations
  easier.

- CLIENTS: Cleaned up error reporting for communication objects like
  variables and domains. If there is a communication level problem between
  client and server, an error code of KS_ERR_NETWORKERROR was issued in
  releases before 1.0.2 of the C++ Communication Library. Beginning with
  this release 1.0.2 the error code of the server is reported instead
  by the communication object, if you call getLastResult() on it. Thus,
  KS_ERR_NETWORKERROR no longer means that there were a problem either
  in the low-level communication **or** on the ACPLT/KS layer, but instead
  now indicates **only** low-level communication problems. For instance, you
  will get a KS_ERR_BADAUTH instead of KS_ERR_NETWORKERROR.

- CLIENTS: Cleaned up error reporting through packages and data exchange
  packages: when the communication with an ACPLT/KS server fails, then the
  error code is propagated to all variable objects in a package which refer
  to this server. Only in this case the package itself will return an error
  code of KS_ERR_NETWORKERROR. So there are basically these cases:

  * package.getUpdate() == true && package.getLastResult() == KS_ERR_OK
    Everything is okay. The variables have been successfully read or
    written.

  * package.getUpdate() == false && package.getLastResult() == KS_ERR_OK
    Communication with the ACPLT/KS server succeeded but some variables
    could not be read/written. Reasons for this could be either invalid
    path names or access restrictions for individual variables.

  * package.getUpdate() == false && package.getLastResult() == KS_ERR_NETWORKERROR
    Communication with one or more ACPLT/KS servers failed. Variables
    located in other servers could be read/written nevertheless. The variable
    objects whose values could not be read/written will return a more precise
    error code indicating the cause for the failure.
    
  * package.getUpdate() == false && package.getLastResult() == some other error code
    The package object failed to initiate the communication. Reasons for
    this can be memory constraints. The error code returned by getLastResult()
    specifies the reason for failure more precise.


Version 1.01
- SERVERS: The constructor sof the classes KsServer and KsSimpleServer now
  have an optional parameter "port" which can be used to "bind" a ACPLT/KS
  server to a specific port number. This is necessary when ACPLT/KS servers
  should be accessed from outside a firewall. If you do not need to bind to
  a specific port, then use the pre-defined constant KsServerBase::KS_ANYPORT.
  Because this port parameter is optional, existing code will not break but
  simply needs to be re-compiled.

- SERVERS: New classes KsInAddrSet and KsHostInAddrSet for checking IP
  addresses of incomming requests again a lists of allowed or forbidden IP
  addresses.

- SERVERS: ntksmanager.exe and tmanager.exe now deny register requests from
  remote "servers". tmanager.exe now does this also on OpenVMS. (On un*x
  operating systems this was never a problem from the early beginnings of
  the ACPLT/KS C++ Communication Library, so guess which operating systems
  are *true* server operating systems...)

- SERVERS: support for "service processes" under Windooze 95, see the
  documentation for the class KsW95ServiceServer in the Technology Paper #8
  for details.

- CLIENTS: A bug in the KscPackageClass has been corrected which crashed ACPLT/KS
  clients trying to remove a variable or package from a KscPackage object.

- CLIENTS: See TP#8 for how to control the timeout and retry values, which
  control how long an ACPLT/KS client will wait for an answer from a server and
  if a connection breaks down how often the client will try to reconnect
  automatically before the timeout is reported to the calling application.

- ALL: The classes PltPtrHandle and PltArrayHandle now have operators for
  tests on equality or non-equality implemented. The operator==() checks
  whether both handles *point to the same* object or both are unbound.
  In this case the operator returns true. The operator!=() is just the
  opposite.

- ALL: On Windows NT, the file ntksmanager.exe contains version information,
  which indicates the release level, copyright, and more. Please note, that
  due to a bug in Windows NT (*a* bug?!), you can't see this information
  in the Explorer, if the file is located on a network drive. The same applies
  to the w95ksmanager.exe file which is a ACPLT/KS manager service process
  for Windows 95.

4. Suggested Readings
---------------------

Well -- all "Technology Papers" of course. But for a quick start you
should first make yourself familiar with the object model of ACPLT/KS
(Technology Paper #4). If you plan to write a KS server, then you
should read the "Technology Paper #3" too. In every case, you should
take a look at the "Technology Paper #8", as it is the reference guide
to the C++ communication library.
