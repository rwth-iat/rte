ACPLT/KS C++ Communication Library
==================================

This is the Version 1.01.

For up-to-date information see
    http://www.plt.rwth-aachen.de/ks/english
or
    http://www.plt.rwth-aachen.de/ks (German)

From there, you can also download the "Technology Paper #8" which
describes the "C++ Communication Library" in detail.


1. Introduction
---------------

The "C++ Communication Library" eases the integration of the open
communication system ACPLT/KS into applications, thus enabling them to
operate directly with process data.


2. Compiling the Library
------------------------

2.1 Un*x
--------

Make sure you have the right tools: gcc, gmake, and perl.

Change to the root of the library tree, that is the "acplt" directory,
where this README file is stored too. Choose your weapons -- pardon,
operating system -- and then do:

  $ make linux.all

This will build the library as well as some example applications. If
appropriate, replace "linux" with either "hpux", or "solaris".


2.2 NT
------

On NT, take your chances, and do:

  X:\acplt> make -f makefile.nt nt.all

During the compilation of the example applications you will see some
linker warnings like:

  Warning: Extern '_xdr_XXX' was not qualified with __import in module XXX

You can safely ignore these warnings, as there is some compiler/linker
magic necessary to export variables from DLLs unter Windows NT/95, and
this magic gets sometimes dazzled (bad magic, huh?).


3. Suggested Readings
---------------------

Well -- all "Technology Papers" of course. But for a quick start you
should first make yourself familiar with the object model of ACPLT/KS
(Technology Paper #4). If you plan to write a KS server, then you
should read the "Technology Paper #3" too. In every case, you should
take a look at the "Technology Paper #8", as it is the reference guide
to the C++ communication library.

Enjoy using the C++ communication library!
