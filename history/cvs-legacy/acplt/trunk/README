ACPLT/KS C++ Communication Library
==================================

This is the Version 1.01 of the C++ Communication Libary. It contains
bug-fixes and some small improvements behind the scenes. For details
about bug-fixes and changes, see part 3 "Changes & Bug-Fixes" below.

But now, compile and enjoy --
  Your ACPLT/KS team <ks@plt.rwth-aachen.de>


1. Introduction
---------------

The "C++ Communication Library" eases the integration of the open
communication system ACPLT/KS into applications, thus enabling them to
operate directly with process data.

For up-to-date information see
    http://www.plt.rwth-aachen.de/ks/english
or
    http://www.plt.rwth-aachen.de/ks (German)

From there, you can also download the "Technology Paper #8" which
describes the "C++ Communication Library" in detail.


2. Compiling the Library
------------------------

2.1 Un*x
--------

Make sure you have the right tools: gcc, gmake, and perl.

Change to the root of the library tree, that is the "acplt" directory,
where this README file is stored too. Choose your weapons -- pardon,
operating system -- and then do:

  $ make linux.all

This will build the library as well as some example applications. If
appropriate, replace "linux" with either "hpux", or "solaris".


2.2 NT
------

On NT, take your chances, and do:

  X:\acplt> make -f makefile.nt nt.all

During the compilation of the example applications you will see some
linker warnings like:

  Warning: Extern '_xdr_XXX' was not qualified with __import in module XXX

You can safely ignore these warnings, as there is some compiler/linker
magic necessary to export variables from DLLs unter Windows NT/95, and
this magic gets sometimes dazzled (bad magic, huh?).


3. Changes & Bug-Fixes
----------------------

- SERVERS: The constructor of the class KsServerBase now has a non-optional
  parameter "port" which can be used to "bind" a ACPLT/KS server to a
  specific port number. This is necessary when ACPLT/KS servers should be
  accessed from outside a firewall. If you do not need to bind to a specific
  port, then use the pre-defined constant KsServerBase::KS_ANYPORT.
  Because KsServerBase is the virtual base class for every ACPLT/KS server,
  you'll need to call its constructor explicitly from your server's constructor.

  For example:

    class MyServer : public KsServer, public KsSimpleServer {
        MyServer();
    }

    MyServer::MyServer()
      : KsServerBase(KS_ANYPORT), KsServer(30)
    { ... }

- SERVERS: New classes KsInAddrSet and KsHostInAddrSet for checking IP
  addresses of incomming requests again a lists of allowed or forbidden IP
  addresses.

- SERVERS: ntksmanager.exe and tmanager.exe now deny register requests from
  remote "servers". tmanager.exe now does this also on OpenVMS. (On un*x
  operating systems this was never a problem from the early beginnings of
  the ACPLT/KS C++ Communication Library, so guess which operating systems
  are *true* server operating systems...)

- CLIENTS: A bug in the KscPackageClass has been corrected which crashed ACPLT/KS
  clients trying to remove a variable or package from a KscPackage object.

- CLIENTS: See TP#8 for how to control the timeout and retry values, which
  control how long a ACPLT/KS client will wait for an answer from a server and
  if a connection breaks down how often the client will try to reconnect
  automatically before the timeout is reported to the calling application.

- ALL: The classes PltPtrHandle and PltArrayHandle now have operators for
  tests on equality or non-equality implemented. The operator==() checks
  whether both handles *point to the same* object or both are unbound.
  In this case the operator returns true. The operator!=() is just the
  opposite.

- ALL: On Windows NT, the file ntksmanager.exe contains version information,
  which indicates the release level, copyright, and more. Please note, that
  due to a bug in Windows NT (*a* bug?!), you can't see this information
  in the Explorer, if the file is located on a network drive.

4. Suggested Readings
---------------------

Well -- all "Technology Papers" of course. But for a quick start you
should first make yourself familiar with the object model of ACPLT/KS
(Technology Paper #4). If you plan to write a KS server, then you
should read the "Technology Paper #3" too. In every case, you should
take a look at the "Technology Paper #8", as it is the reference guide
to the C++ communication library.
