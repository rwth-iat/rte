ACPLT/KS C++ Communication Library
==================================


1. Introduction
---------------

The "C++ Communication Library" is intended to ease the integration of
the open communication system ACPLT/KS into applications, thus
enabling them to operate directly with process data.


2. Compiling the Library
------------------------

Make sure you have the right tools.

Change to the root of the library tree, that is the "acplt" directory,
where this README file is stored too. Choose your weapons -- pardon,
operating system -- and then do (on Un*x):

  $ make linux.all

This will build the library as well as some example applications. Replace
"linux" with either "hpux", or "solaris".

On NT take your chances, and do:

  > make -f makefile.bc nt.all


3. Suggested Readings
---------------------

Well -- all "Technology Papers" of course. But for a quick start you
should first make yourself familiar with the object model of ACPLT/KS
(Technology Paper #4). If you plan to write a KS server, then you
should read the "Technology Paper #3" too. In every case, you should
take a look at the "Technology #8", as it is the reference guide to
the C++ communication library.

We hope that you enjoy using the C++ communication library!
