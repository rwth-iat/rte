version 1.11</A></H3>

<P>In version 1.11 now finally the variable "svc_fdset" is exported by
oncrpc.dll. A good news for all of you who want to write their own server
loop.
While there still is no complete C++ integration, rpcgen now generates
header-files with "#ifdef __cplusplus" and allows to call the stubs
directly from C++ (with the additional "CLIENT" parameter).
The portmapper service now accepts a "-v" flag. If this is not given it
will no longer trash the application log with useless messages about (not) found
services (Thanks to Martin Johnson).
I removed the VC++ Development Studio files as they contained absolute
pathnames from my environment, so that were probably useless and confusing
for anybody else.</P>
